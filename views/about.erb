			I'm an adventure seeker. I think the purpose of life is to experience what we can while we're here. I'm driven by responsibility and productivity, and nothing makes me happier than seeing myself and those around me seek and find self-improvement. My goal is to learn, connect, and grow, so that I may understand as many perspectives as I can.

			<h3>Noteable Accomplishments</h3>
			<p>
				I started a chapter of the conversational and marketing approach-based activist organization, Anonymous for the Voiceless, in Salt Lake City, Utah, in May 2017. After creating a Facebook page for general animal rights activism in Salt Lake and gaining interest through local social media accounts, I organized potlucks and meetings with a scattered group of passionate individuals. The group now has a strong core of about 15 activists and steadily holds one or two activist "Cube of Truth" events monthly. These events draw many interested but less-committed activists every time and now events have volunteers numbering in the mid-thirties.

				When I was 17 years old I did my first solo backpacking trip. As a high school senior project, I was able to use family airline miles to visit Ireland, where for three weeks I experimented with travel writing, met fellow travelers in hostels, walked, biked, and rode public transportation to see the majority of Southern Ireland.

				When I was 19 years old I did my second solo backpacking trip, this time to Peru, again on foot and in hostels, where for one month I stretched my Spanish language skills, visited some of the many incredible archeological sites there, including Machu Picchu, partied with travelers from around the world, and sated my "travel bug", for a while.

			<h3>Code</h3>
			<p>
				After deciding that a carreer in mechanical engineering wasn't the path for me, I spent a lot of time seriously looking at myself, my skills, my passions, and my dreams. Many paths led to writing code, especially web development. I love that it's about continual self-education, I love that it's about breaking big problems into manageable pieces, and I love how creative, dynamic, and diverse this field can be.
